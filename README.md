# tab-nav Firefox Extension

A simple Manifest v3 extension allowing users to override keyboard shortcuts to navigate between tabs. Because Firefox does not allow users to override the keyboard shortcuts to move focus between tabs, this extensions adds the follwing commands when installed:

## Supported Commands
* Move to previous tab (default: Ctrl/Cmd + Down): Move to the tab left of the active tab.
* Move to next tab (default: Ctrl/Cnd + Up): Move to the tab right of the active tab.

## Configuration
To override the default shortcuts applied by this extension, navigate to `about:addons` and select "Manage Extension Shortcuts" under the gear menu.
